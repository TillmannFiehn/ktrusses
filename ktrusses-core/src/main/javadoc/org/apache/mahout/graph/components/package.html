<title>Graph algorithms that return components</title>
</head>
<body>
	This package contains two powerful graph algorithms that return
	components:
	<ol>
		<li>{@link org.apache.mahout.graph.components.FindComponentsJob}
			which finds the components of a graph.</li>
		<li>{@link org.apache.mahout.graph.components.FindKTrussesJob}
			which finds the <code>k</code>-trusses in a graph. A <code>k</code>-truss
			is a nontrivial, single-component maximal subgraph, such that every
			edge is contained in at least <code>k-2</code> triangles in the
			subgraph. The algorithm was proposed in the IEEE paper <em>J.
				Cohen 2009: "Graph Twiddling in a MapReduce World"</em>.</li>
	</ol>
